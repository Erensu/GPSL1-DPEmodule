## Description
DPE_module is a Direct Position Estimation (DPE) plug-in module that can be integrated into existing two-step positioning MATLAB SDRs. 
It is currently integrated into SOftGNSS v3.0 from the text: "A Software-Defined GPS and Galileo Receiver: A Single-Frequency Approach" by Borre, Akos, et.al.

This repo and my entire research will not be possible without Prof Borre's EASY suite, the seminal work on GPS software receiver by Prof Akos, and their generous willingness to open-source SoftGNSS v3.0. 

I, Sergio Vicenzo, hereby do not claim ownership or responsibility to Prof. Borre's and Prof. Akos' SOftGNSS v.3.0. All the changes made to the SoftGNSS v3.0 software have been labelled in the code, in accordance to GNU General Public License.
