His research interests include GNSS urban navigation and positioning with direct position estimation.

## Description
DPE_module is a Direct Position Estimation (DPE) plug-in module that can be integrated into existing two-step positioning MATLAB SDRs. 
It is currently integrated into SoftGNSS v3.0 from the text: "A Software-Defined GPS and Galileo Receiver: A Single-Frequency Approach" by Borre, Akos, et.al.
Parts of SoftGNSSv3.0 have been adapted to allow the DPE module to be integrated into it. 

## How to use
The following code works the same way as the SoftGNSSv3.0. Further information on using the code can be found in the original SoftGNSSv3.0 readme ("readme - SoftGNSS.txt") and ppt ("GPS_L1_CA_SDR.pdf").

More details on the DPE module soon...
